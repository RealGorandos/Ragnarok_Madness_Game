# Ragnarok Madness Porject
Inspired from games such as <strong>Disgaea</strong>, our team, compramised of 3 developers, decided to create an isometric game with its engine from scratch. Mainly this project was developed to accomplish the course "Tools of Software techrnology" at the university of ELTE (Eötvös Loránd University). In this course you are required to create some application considering many aspects, such as CI, CD, teamwork, and opensource project developement.

# Controls
This is a simple demo showing the capabilities of our Game Engine and what it can achieve. Down below, we will explain on how to create your own simple isometric game based on the "Ragnarok Game Engine". However, in this section we will explain the basic game controls and rules. 

### In-Game Controls
w/up_arrow : Move the player up.
<br/>
a/left_arrow : Move the player left.
<br/>
d/right_arrow : Move the player right.
<br/>
s/down_arrow : Move the player down.
<br/>
e : loot from ItemCapsules.
<br/>
esc : return back to the main menu.
<br/>
left_mouse_button : fires bullets from the player main weapon toward the pressed direction.
<br/>

### Main Menu Controls
Only the mouse is working on the main menu.

### Settings Menu Controls
Only the mouse is wokring on the settings menu.

# Gameplay and Rules
After clicking on the "Start" button in the main menu, you will be taken to the game scene, or -in other words- level. The game level demo that we prepared let you start with a player, 2 Foes (enemies) and a "loot box"/"Item Capsules" near you. Your mission is not to get killed by the foes while enjoying exploring the map. The game is a free-roaming game, which means it will not end after killing the 2 Foes. For exiting the game you will have to go back to the main menu and exit the game manually. However, if you get killed by the foes, a popup window will show that you have died and then the game will exit.

# Lunching the Game
There are several ways to lunch the given demo. Easiest one is to click on the ux_build for lunching it on linux and ws_build for lunching it on windows. However, make sure to have a JRE and JVM installed and the paths are configured (Most devices and OS comes pre-configured. Therefore, you don't need to worry about it much). Another way would be to use our maven builder, which gives you more freedom to test/compile/build and more! To use maven build, make sure to have maven installed on your machine. Furthermore, you can lunch the game with eclipse since the project files are attached in the repository. Finally, you can download the JAR file directly from the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WWuRuRJs5xWzqpL-4-UXZm4yYPCz3QWZ">Artifactory</a> and run the game.
